# ArrayFixed

`ArrayFixed` is a fixed length sparse JavaScript array. The main advantage of a fixed length sparse array, is that we maintain a count along with the array length. Extending on the fixed length sparse array, we create a fixed length sparse array that is dense in one direction (left or right). The `ArrayFixedDense` ensures that the array is kept dense in one particular direction.
